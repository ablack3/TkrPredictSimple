The objective of this study is to develop and validate various patient-level prediction models for total knee replacement patients. 


Introduction
============
This repo contains the simple models needed for validation of the Oxford Ehden study-athon simple models to predict mortality following a total knee replacement

Features
========
  - Validates the full models developed in Thin and OptumDod as well as a user designed simple and a data driven simple developed in optumDod
  
  - Included in the package are 4 models they are:
    - Analysis_1: the full mdoel developed in optumDod
    - Analysis_1001: the simple model using user defined inputs
    - Analysis_1002: the simple model using data driven development methods (high penalisation)
    - Analysis_2: the full model developed on THIN

Technology
==========
  oxfordKneeValidation is an R package.

System Requirements
===================
  Requires R (version 3.3.0 or higher).

Dependencies
============
  * PatientLevelPrediction

Getting Started
===============
  1. In R, use the following commands to run the study:

  ```r
  # If not building locally uncomment and run:
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github('ohdsi-studies/TkrPredictSimple')

library(oxfordKneeValidation)

# Specify where the temporary files (used by the ff package) will be created:
options(fftempdir = "T:/temp")

# Details for connecting to the server:
dbms <- ""
user <- ""
pw <- ""
server <- ""
port <-

connectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(dbms = dbms,
                                                                server = server,
                                                                user = user,
                                                                password = pw,
                                                                port = port)



# Add the database containing the OMOP CDM data
cdmDatabaseSchema <- ''
# Add a sharebale name for the database containing the OMOP CDM data
cdmDatabaseName <- ''
# Add a database with read/write access as this is where the cohorts will be generated
cohortDatabaseSchema <- ''

oracleTempSchema <- ""

outputFolder <- ""
cohortTable <- ''


# Now run the study
oxfordKneeValidation::execute(connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
                              databaseName = cdmDatabaseName,
                              cdmDatabaseSchema = cdmDatabaseSchema,
                              cohortDatabaseSchema = cohortDatabaseSchema,
                              oracleTempSchema = oracleTempSchema,
                              cohortTable = cohortTable,
                              outputFolder = outputFolder,
                              createCohorts = T,
                              runValidation = T,
                              runSimple = T,
                              packageResults = F,
                              minCellCount = 5,
                              sampleSize = NULL)
